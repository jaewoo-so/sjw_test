Searching similar drugs for hidden drugs</h3><hr /><p>First, we performed the gene expression signature search via spearman correlation calculation. As a reference data, L1000, which was signaturized for each drug through MODZ, and PANACEA was used as a query for this. The similarity between drugs was calculated by spearman correlation. We chose similar drugs with the following criteria. By calculating robust z-score for the similarity matrix, only drugs corresponding to more than 70% of the max value of z-score were collected for each query drug. For example, for the above method, there are 7 and 19 drugs selected as drugs similar to cmpd_KW and cmpd_WW, respectively.</p><p align="center"> <img width="400" src="./img/z_score_thereshold.png" /></p><p> </p><h3 id="step2-modeling--prediction">Step2. Modeling &amp; Prediction</h3><hr /><p>As shown above, a drug-specific model was created using only the selected perturbations for each hidden drug. The model approached the regression problem using the GBDT to predict the AUC value according to the cell line-drug pairs given in the CTRP and used features describing the above mentioned. We use CART for base learner with histogram optimized approximate greedy algorithm. We finally found out that roughly 3000 features exhibited the best performance, and we actually saw that performance was not significantly reduced even if we reduced to 7 feature sets through dimension reduction. The most efficient dimensional reduction model was the Autoencoder model with MSE + Correlation*0.7 as the objective, but due to the complicated analysis, we use the gradient boosting method with the CART for base learner and use a very small number of sampled features. And by overfitting each prediction model to a specific set of drugs, final ensemble model had better generalization performance since the diversity of models increased.</p><p align="center"> <img width="800" src="./img/structure.png" alt="Material Bread logo" /></p><p> </p><h3 id="step3-ensemble">Step3. Ensemble</h3><p>For generalization performance, we implemented a model ensemble. Using the results of varying the threshold value from 20% to 90% of max with z-score as shown above, correlation between the results of each model was compared. To use more diverse models, eight models were finally selected in the order in which they were less correlated with each other, and the predicted results were integrated to create a final presentation file. Detail procedure is like this.</p><p>\(\mathcal{M} \textrm{ is set of models,} \mathcal{M} := \{ M_1 , \cdots , M_n \}, \mathcal{D} : \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{R} \textrm{ is distance function}\) and we define average distance over each model.</p>\[\mathcal{D}_{avg}(M_i) = \frac{1}{| \mathcal{M} \setminus { \{i\} } |} \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M} \backslash {\{i\}} } \mathcal{D}(M_i,m)\]<p>next, we select candidate for ensemble .</p>\[\mathcal{M}_{candidate} :=\{ \mathcal{M}_i | \mathcal{D}_{avg}(M_i) \ngeq \textrm{ 90th percentile} \}\]<p>finaly, define of ensemble score is like below .</p>\[S_{ensemble} = exp( \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}_{candidate}|} \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M}_{candidate}} log( \mathcal{D}_{avg}(m)) )\]<p><br /> <br /></p><h1 id="3-conclusion--discussion">3. Conclusion &amp; Discussion</h1><p>We started from the assumption that we could deduce the MoA of the drug via post-treatment gene expression on the drug. It is difficult to predict drug sensitivities that have specific targets and specific pathways(Koras, K et al. 2020). So, we recognized the need to make models for each drug, and we tried many things, such as looking at which gene has high coefficient for each drug by predicting AUC with only gene expression, in addition to the methods described above. Our experiments have also shown that it is better to make a model for each drugs than to use one model predicting the AUC for all drugs. Each cell line has its own unique characteristics, so it is very meaningful to use it as a feature that can explain it. Predicting the drug sensitivities for each cell line will be very useful in selecting cell lines in experimental screening and also valuable in the field of new drug development in reducing costs. Since we didn’t have enough time to find the optimal model, we had no choice but to use the naive experimental results, so I think we can improve the predictive performance through more accurate experiments.</p><p><br /> <br /></p><h1 id="4-references">4.

Feature Engineering</h1><p><strong>1. Data Integration</strong> <br /> Different public datasets have different gene types. Alternatively, you can use a gene set that you deem valid based on domain knowledge. Strategies other than intersection result in missing value unconditionally. Therefore, the method of imputating the missing value must also be selected. <br /> In this project, we compared two methods using gene sets judged to be valid through intersection and paper search, and found that the performance of intersection is similar. Therefore, we used an intersection geneset with a small data size. (973 genes.)</p><p><strong>2.
